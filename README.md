# The-end-of-the-diamond-
IS this the end..?

As most of you might know about the Diamond Eyes Incident.
This might be the end, the person behind all this has not confirmed it but has said: ''My team can be ending the Diamond Cord Incident''

Why he started this and 5 days later decieded to end it, is still unclear! 

What is diamond cord acctualy?

We have Three /README.MD!

1st : https://github.com/discordnews/Diamond-eyes-
2nd : https://github.com/discordnews/Diamond-Cord-
3rd : https://github.com/discordnews/The-end-of-the-diamond-

What can they do exactly? no one knows the answer..

Diamond Eyes + Retro Team, is probably the most brute cyberpunks to be known for discord and even Roblox!

Retro Team is a whole diffrent story, we have gotten informatino that Diamond Eyes will be working with Retro Team! 

Retro Team :

Retro team is known for there populair bot called : RetroMonitored, This bot is for monitoring people, they claim to be doing it for the good way but where does this information go to? and to who!? We have not really anything to do with the Roblox Groups but this is very serious! 

If Retro Team and diamond eyes start working togheter, what can happen..!
